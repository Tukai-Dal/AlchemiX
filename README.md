# AlchemiX

I came up with the name AlchemiX during the 2nd year of my CS undergrad. The task was to be creative with Javascript's drag and drop feature.

India has long and ancient history with medicinal herbs and their mixes for a lot of practical use. The idea was to make an attractive UI where correct herb mixes will make a mixture and wrong mix will break the vial. Water is added by default and shown as a blooming flower.

Here's a link to the video showing how it all works.

FYI: I came up with this name back then around 2015 and now I see there is a very popular app named Alchemix (https://alchemix.fi/) that came out in 2020! :D. They promote self-repaying loans.
